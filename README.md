##Â Unix and Node Slides

![Example side](https://github.com/alexyoung/node-unix-slides/raw/master/node-unix.png)

These are the shell scripts I used for a talk on Node and Unix

### Calibration

I designed the slides so text should be positioned correctly in any terminal, but to make them look the way I intended run `cat node.ans` then increase the terminal's font size until it fits in the centre of the screen.

### Colours and Fonts

I ran this in iTerm2 using the [Menlo for Powerline](https://gist.github.com/1595572) font.
